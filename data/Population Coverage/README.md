# üåç Population Coverage Input Files

This folder contains input text files used for population coverage analysis in the IEDB Population Coverage Tool.

### Files:
- **mhc_class_I_epitope_alleles.txt:** Lists each CTL (Class I) epitope with its associated HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C alleles.
- **mhc_class_II_epitope_alleles.txt:** Lists each HTL (Class II) epitope with its associated HLA-DR, DQ, and DP alleles.
- **bcell_epitopes_list.txt:** Lists selected linear B-cell epitopes used for comparison.

These files were uploaded to IEDB (https://tools.iedb.org/population/) to estimate global and regional population coverage.
